                Nowadays, there's a very common spell which says "You are what you eat". Well, we think that the same thing 
            can be applied in terms of drinks. Taking into consideration that there are plenty of chemicals in both food and drinks, 
            it is of great importance to know what exactly they contain and whether they could be a threaten for our health as we 
            consume them daily. 
            <br>
                Our website is focused only on providig information about drinks, from any allergen and ingredients each drink has to 
            recommendations based on your geographical region, availability, expiration time and so on. Not only that,
